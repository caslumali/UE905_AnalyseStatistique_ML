# UE 905 – Statistical Analyses 📊

Advanced statistical modelling applied to forest inventory data, using linear models, mixed models, and generalized linear models in R.

## 🌍 Project Context

This project was developed as part of the **UE 905 – Statistical Analyses** course in the **SIGMA Master's program** (Agro Toulouse / Université Toulouse II – Jean Jaurès).  

The main objective was to **apply and interpret various statistical models** on forest inventory data collected in southern France, focusing on:
- the effects of spatial sampling designs on tree diameters (DBH),
- the influence of past logging events,
- and the occurrence of cavities in different species.

## 🧪 Analyses Performed

1. **ANOVA** — Testing the effect of sampling plots on *Carpinus betulus* DBH.  
2. **Linear regression** — Exploring the relationship between `lastLog` (time since last logging) and DBH for *Quercus* species.  
3. **Hierarchical ANOVA** — Grouping sampling plots into spatial triangles to test structured spatial effects.  
4. **Linear mixed model (LMM)** — Assessing whether `lastLog` explains plot-level variability.  
5. **Binomial GLM** — Modelling the presence of tree cavities as a function of DBH and site characteristics.

Each model includes **diagnostics of residuals**, **hypothesis verification**, and a detailed interpretation of the results.
